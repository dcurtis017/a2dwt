Chapter 3: Navigation

You can split an application into one root module and one ore more feature modules. Feature modules can be loaded eagerly or lazily.

To lazy load a module use the loadChildren property of in teh route configuration. You would then configure the path in the components to be empty.

Routes are configured using RouterModule.

You can select a location strategy to control how the url looks.

The router outputs content into the <router-outlet> tags. There can be more than one router-outlet

Use the routerLink property instead of the href attribute
